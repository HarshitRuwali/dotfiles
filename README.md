## Setting up a fresh environment 

If you are on a [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) or Arch Based system like [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.com/)... then just run the setup.sh script. 

You will be prompted for the passwod to install the necessary packages. And dont run the script as `root` otherwise the config files will be placed on the root's home directory.


Mod Key is Windows/Super.


Picom/Compton:
 - I am on Arch Based system so for me its Picom. And for Debian based system is Compton.
